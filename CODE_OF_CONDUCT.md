We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

## How it works

Examples of behaviour that promote a positive environment:

Examples of non-acceptable behaviour:

* Offensive comments
* Comments that reinforce social dominance structures
* Sexual images in public spaces without previous consent
* Stalking or intimidating
* Taking pictures or recording without consent
* Interrupting continuosly
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Undesired sexual attention
* Promote any of the above
